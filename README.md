# Java Hello World Sample

This project contains a simple servlet application.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/java-helloworld)

## Running the application using the command-line

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application locally:

1. Execute full Maven build to create the `target/JavaHelloWorldApp.war` file:
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. Download and install Liberty, then use it to run the built application from step 1:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

    Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp](http://localhost:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp).

Use the following command to run the built application in Bluemix:
    ```bash
    $ cf push <appname> -p target/JavaHelloWorldApp.war
    ```
## Developing and Deploying using Eclipse

IBM® Eclipse Tools for Bluemix® provides plug-ins that can be installed into an existing Eclipse environment to assist in integrating the developer's integrated development environment (IDE) with Bluemix.

1. Download and install  [IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Eclipse_Tools_for_Bluemix).

2. Import this sample into Eclipse using `File` -> `Import` -> `Maven` -> `Existing Maven Projects` option.

3. Create a Liberty server definition:
